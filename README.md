￼# Behavior Drill: Style Editor Challenge
Forms are what allows users to send data to the server. They are much more than just logging in and signing up for email newsletters.
In this challenge, we're going to play with forms not as tools for sending data to the server, but as a way to allow users to manipulate the DOM using JavaScript. Specifically, we're going to build a form that will allow a user to dynamically change the styles.
The purpose of this drill is to become familiar with using JavaScript to "grab" user-inputted data from a form and funnel it to the desired function.
To make it work, you should be familiar with the following concepts:
[Basics of jQuery Events](http://learn.jquery.com/events/event-basics/) and [Event Handling] (http://learn.jquery.com/events/handling-events/) , specifically the submit event
The jQuery [val() method](http://api.jquery.com/val/) and [css() method](http://api.jquery.com/css/)
If you bind to the submit event, you should consider using the [event.preventDefault() method] (http://api.jquery.com/event.preventDefault/) provided by jQuery.
##Objectives ###Dynamic Styling
It may seem obvious what you have to do, but just to make it extra clear what the expected behavior is:
Enter a CSS selector (e.g. h1, #header, .faded) into the left input field
Enter a CSS property (e.g. color, padding, text-align) into the center input field
Enter a CSS value for the property (e.g. if the property is color, enter something like blue or #00f) Click the button and watch the page magically transform before your eyes!
Here is a video showing this behavior in action:

￼In its essence, the solution to this problem can be broken down into three parts: (1) retrieving the values from the form, (2) passing those values into the correct jQuery function for manipulating CSS, and (3) binding the previous two parts to a particular event using an event handler. If you think about it this way, you will (hopefully) write much cleaner and more loosely coupled code.
If you are having trouble solving this problem, ask yourself the following questions:
Is my code correctly bound to the appropriate event? If not, how can I test for this? Do I know how to retreive the values from the form?
Am I correctly passing the user data into the function that modifies the page styles?
